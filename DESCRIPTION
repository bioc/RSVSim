Description: RSVSim is a package for the simulation of deletions,
        insertions, inversion, tandem-duplications and translocations
        of various sizes in any genome available as FASTA-file or
        BSgenome data package. SV breakpoints can be placed uniformly
        accross the whole genome, with a bias towards repeat regions
        and regions of high homology (for hg19) or at user-supplied
        coordinates.
